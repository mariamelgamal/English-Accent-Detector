# English-Accent-Detector

In the final project report we explain the rationale, implementation and results of our English Accent Detector. The aim of our project is to predict the country or region of origin of the speaker from their English pronunciation and accent. Many applications of this work include language teaching, video game development and advanced speech recognition. Previous work in the literature focused on classifying two English accents using different preprocessing and machine learning techniques. Our work proposes preprocessing approaches to classify around 16 different English accents using Mozillaâ€™s Open source speech dataset, Common Voice. We then optimize for different neural network models to outperform the accent classification reported in the literature by around 20% increase in accuracy.
